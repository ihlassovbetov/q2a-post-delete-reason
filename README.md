<br>
<ul class="first">
	<b>Plugin Functionality:</b>
	<li>Admin can set 10 post deletion reason category in admin settings.</li>
	<li>When a post is deleted by authorised user, it requires to add reason for deletion with an optional comment note.</li>
	<li>This is regarded as round-1. And in round-1 (first delete with a reason), posts are not directly deleted, but queued.</li>
	<li>The post owner has an option to review the post and submit an edit in round-1.</li>
	<li>After the owner submits edit, the admin again has option to reject edit with a reason or accept it (this is round-2).</li>
	<li>The decision in round-2 is final decision. But it is not direct delete of post again, rather it permanently hides the post. But the owner does not have any option to turn it back.</li>  
	<li>Plugin adds the posts at round-1 into admin/moderate page, and posts at round-2 to admin/hidden page.</li>  
	<li>Plugin adds a sub navigation page at users profile page named "Deleted Posts" with its count.</li> 
	<li>Users can see their "Deleted Posts" there and submit edits if it is in round-1.</li>
	<li>These workflow does not conflict with original Q2A queueing or deleting processes.</li>
	<li>In admin setting, there is also a "CheckFix" button. This can be used to fix mismatches of post status at post-deleted and posts table, caused by manual database edits or other plugins edits on post types.</li>
